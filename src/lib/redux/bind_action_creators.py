	"""
 	Turns an object whose values are action creators, into an object with the
 	same keys, but with every function wrapped into a `dispatch` call so they
 	may be invoked directly. This is just a convenience method, as you can call
 	`store['dispatch'](MyActionCreators['doSomething']())` yourself just fine.
 
 	For convenience, you can also pass a single function as the first argument,
 	and get a function in return.
 
 	@param {Function|Object} actionCreators An object whose values are action
 	creator functions.
 	You may also pass a single function.
 
 	@param {Function} dispatch The `dispatch` function available on your Redux
 	store.
 	
 	@returns {Function|Object} The object mimicking the original object, but with
 	every action creator wrapped into the `dispatch` call. If you passed a
 	function as `actionCreators`, the return value will also be a single
 	function.
