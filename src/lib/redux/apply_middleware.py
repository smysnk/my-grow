def apply_middleware(*middlewares):
	"""Creates a store enhancer that applies middleware to the dispatch method
	of the Redux store. This is handy for a variety of tasks, such as expressing
	asynchronous actions in a concise manner, or logging every action payload.
 
	See `redux-thunk` package as an example of the Redux middleware.
 
	Because middleware is potentially asynchronous, this should be the first
	store enhancer in the composition chain.
 
	Note that each middleware will be given the `dispatch` and `getState` functions
	as named arguments.
 
	@param {*Function} middlewares The middleware chain to be applied.
	@returns {Function} A store enhancer applying the middleware.
